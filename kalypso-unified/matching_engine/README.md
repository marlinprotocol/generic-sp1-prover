# Kalypso Matching Engine
ZK-proof marketplace: Matching Engine.

Kalypso is a ZK-proof marketplace. It allows applications to outsource the generation of ZK proofs to a network of hardware providers for better cost and time efficiency. A competitive market motivates hardware providers to innovate, reduce costs and increase the speed of proof generation. 

At the core of Kalypso is a sophisticated Matching Engine. It actively monitors new proof requests from the Kalypso core contracts, submitted by the users. The matching engine then builds and updates a local order book from all the proof requests, published to the Kalypso core contracts, to perform further matching. The matching engine follows the matching protocol to match proof requests with the set of proof generators (solvers) in their respective markets. Once a request is matched to a solver, it creates a task T and publishes it to the on-chain Kalypso protocol.
