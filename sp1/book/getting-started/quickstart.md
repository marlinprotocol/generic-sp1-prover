# Quickstart

In this section, we will show you how to create a simple Fibonacci program using the SP1 zkVM.

## Create Project

The first step is to create a new project using the `cargo prove new <name>` command. This command will create a new folder in your current directory.

```bash
cargo prove new fibonacci
cd fibonacci
```

This will create a new project with the following structure:

```
.
├── program
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   ├── elf
│   └── src
│       └── main.rs
└── script
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── src
        └── main.rs

6 directories, 4 files
```

There are 2 directories (each a crate) in the project: 
- `program`: the source code that will be proven inside the zkVM.
- `script`: code that contains proof generation and verification code.

We recommend you install the [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) extension.
Note that if you use `cargo prove new` inside a monorepo, you will need to add the manifest file to `rust-analyzer.linkedProjects` to get full IDE support.

## Generate Proof

The program simply computes the `n`-th Fibonacci number.

Before we can run the program inside the zkVM, it must be compiled to a RISCV executable using the `succinct` Rust toolchain. This is called an [ELF (Executable and Linkable Format)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format). The `build.rs` file in the `script` directory will use the `cargo prove` toolchain to automatically build the ELF.

To generate a proof, we take the ELF file generated by the `build.rs` file and execute it within the SP1 zkVM. The code in the `script` directory is already scaffolded with a script that has logic to generate a proof, save the proof to disk, and verify it.

```bash
cd script
cargo run --release
```

The output should show
```
...
    Compiling fibonacci-script v0.1.0 (.../fibonacci/script)
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 26.14s
    Running `target/release/fibonacci-script`
a: 205697230343233228174223751303346572685
b: 332825110087067562321196029789634457848
successfully generated and verified proof for the program!
```

The program by default is quite small, so proof generation will only take a few seconds locally. After it completes, the proof will be saved in the `proof-with-io.bin` file and also be verified for correctness.

## Modifying the Program

You can play around with how many rounds of Fibonacci are executed by playing around with `n` (by default set to `186`) in the file `script/src/main.rs`. Integer overflow will cause larger `n` to result in non-fibonacci output, although the proof will still be generated and verified.

The ELF will be automatically rebuilt every time you modify the program. You can verify that the ELF was re-generated by looking in the `elf` directory and for a file called `riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-elf`:
```bash
ls elf # should show riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-elf
```
